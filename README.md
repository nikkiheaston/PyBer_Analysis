# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to compare ride sharing data by city type - divided into three: urban; suburban; and rural. The dataset used in this analysis pulled information from January to mid-May of 2019. 

### Results
As is shown in the dataframe below, there are large differences in ride sharing from urban to rural cities. Urban cities had 1,500 more total rides than rural cities, and 1,000 more than suburban cities. They also have 30 times more total drivers than rural cities, and about 5 times more than suburban cities. Their total fares are double those of suburban cities, and 9 times more than rural cities. Interestingly, the average fare per ride in urban cities is less than both rural and suburban areas, and the average fare per driver is 3 times higher in rural cities than urban, and more than double in suburban cities than urban.

In drilling down into the data by week during January through April, and then plotting the weekly fares on a line graph, the trends for each city type and how they compare to each other are shown as:

As expected, the total fares for urban cities are much higher than suburban and rural cities. There appears to be an uptick in fares towards the later end of February for all city types. March then sees big shifts from week to week in urban cities, whereas suburban and rural cities don't see as dramatic shifts. 

### Summary
After reviewing the data, my recommendations to the CEO of the company are:
- Rural cities need more drivers. They are typically less populated than urban and suburban cities so offering incentives to recruit more drivers may be necessary. They   bring in the highest average fare per ride and with only 78 total drivers, there is a lot of missed opportunity. 
- Suburban cities also need more drivers. They make more on average per ride than urban cities. Consider recruitng more drivers for suburban areas from the urban drivers pool. 
- As mentioned before, urban cities see a lot of shifts up and down in the total fares from late Feburary through March. It appears that they climb too high and then drop. I recommend investigating this further to determine what is causing this rise and fall and addressing the issue. You may need to level out the pricing during that time frame.
